# Typing-Lessons
A game to improve your touch-typing skills.

I created this project to practise on reading from files in C in the first semester of my studies.

Compilation:  
```gcc typinglessons.c -o demo```  

You can execute the program by putting as argument one of the files that are included in the directories Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced.
 
Example:  
 ```./demo BeginnerWrapUp/9```  
 
 When you finish a test, you get your accuracy percentage score, faults and words per second number.
