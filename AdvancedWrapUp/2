Dear Alice,
The scene is a state in the South. A sweet girl
speaks of the sound and sight of the river. Two
men without shame raise the stock sales and the
boy tries to spend too much at the store.
To make a quiet and quick slide down the river,
the men seize the boat while the others, who are
quite ready to serve the girl, sleep.
