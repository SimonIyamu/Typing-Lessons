Father is having all the lot, except the garden,
filled in during the week. Giving in to his
desire, I intend to work the ground. Doctor says
that my health is hardly an excuse, so I had
better decide to make an effort. Indeed, I am
driven either to finish the work in the near
future or pay to have it done.
