It seems the girl has sense, for on a sheet of
paper she writes that her stock of gold is in
reach from a round stone under the small shade
tree. She does not quote the boy, but does refer
to the sorry end of his short study, and in her
reply to his folks she will state how the gold
may still be spent in the right way, which will
stamp the story as real.
Yours sincerely,
