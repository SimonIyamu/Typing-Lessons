Important dinner company in our small apartment
was not common, and November ninth mamma was
solemn in manner. The moment nine American
gentlemen were announced, fun and argument
began. I remember one ancient gentleman, manager
of much more income than mine, who was not tired
as imagined, but funny and human, even if normal
demand, planned movements of modern machines to
Canada, and numbers of men.
