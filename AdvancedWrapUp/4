Dear Mrs. White,
I wish to thank you for the words you wrote 3
weeks ago, and I trust you will write again on a
wrong and waste of war. As I watch the wheels of
events today, I think you value a thing it has
taken me a third of my years to see. In its
trade the world is one whole, and each part in
touch with the other at most times.
