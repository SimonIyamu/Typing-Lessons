I acquired a bequest from a quizzical Quaker.
How to apply it was a quandary. As a quasi
artist, I began in Albuquerque to make a queue
of plaques of chance Indian acquaintances. My
masquerade as an artist of quality in that
land of quite Spanish art and adobe was adequate
and equally unique. Squeezed in quiet, antique
adobe quarters, I began quickly and without
qualms to quit.
