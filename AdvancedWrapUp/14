Our association also has appreciated both your
instructions and the opportunity for
prompt examination and understanding of the new
arrangement, particularly its application to all
information given the public about merchandise
for sale. This has been a real convenience in
our consideration of the entire proposition. I
want to assure you that our cooperation under
the new law will be satisfactory in every way.
