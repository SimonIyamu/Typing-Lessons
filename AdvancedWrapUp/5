The usual farm woman won't see a trade table or
understand its terms, for she is tired with her
efforts to train and teach her young. She has
tried to throw her value into her home, which to
her is worth so much. War cannot be put under
until these women see there is but one world,
which truly is their world. Where will you be
while the thick wheat is harvested? Would you
visit us, using your voice to teach us these
things?
