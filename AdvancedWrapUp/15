Only the earlier, first will is very irregular.
I've already quizzed them about the real hazards
of quarrels over legal prizes of similar size.
From their replies I've realized slowly that the
girls are all right. It really amazes me that
even persons like ourselves promptly seize upon
some hostile relative's version of an earlier
will, which should be recognized as false.
